# Learning
Some Basic Python

Source material www.w3schools.com,  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/

I think the most import was https://docs.python.org/3/

Without a good foundation and understanding how to read documention it makes learning any language difficult but once you get them down it all becomes easier to work with.

I found this to be good practice and if my comments could be better dont hesitate to reach out and give alittle advice. Practice makes perfect and I appreciate the time anyone takes to looks this over.

Hope you find it as helpful as I did!!
